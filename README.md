The project given to me is a menu driven user management Unix based simulation, I have used nano based text-editor, and then I have initialised a file though a variable.
I have made several functions like "add_user()", to add a user into the file!
Then I have made another function named "delete_user()", to delete a certain user which matches the pattern search ("Grep").
Another function called "list_user()", list all the users currently saved in the file!

The file is Command line based Unix file, which hepls to know the different users, list them and delete a user from the file.

The program is displayed as this in the command line:
