# Menu driven user management Unix based simulation

- A simple, menu-driven **User Management System** built for Unix-based environments.  
This command-line project allows you to add, list, and delete users using basic shell commands and text-file storage.

---

## Features

- I have made several functions like "**add_user()**", to add a user into the file!
Then I have made another function named "**delete_user()**", to delete a certain user which matches the pattern search ("Grep").
Another function called "**list_user()**", list all the users currently saved in the file!

---

## Usage

- I have used **nano** based text-editor, and then I have initialised a file though a variable.
